//! Installable bindings for a caller-owned JSI runtime.
//!
//! Rust consumers use `host::Bindings` directly. A JS embedder compiles
//! `JSI_SOURCE` against its own JSI headers, bakes `SQLITE_SOURCE` and/or
//! `PROCESS_SOURCE` with its compiler, and creates an `Adapter` from `JSI_HEADER`. This module
//! links no engine, installs no globals, and owns no application loop.
//!
//! @ref LLP 0068#2-synchronous-and-why — the consumer owns execution
