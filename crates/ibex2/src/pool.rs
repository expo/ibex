//! Workers for host tasks.
//!
//! An async host operation ran on a thread spawned for it and joined after —
//! tens of microseconds of the round trip a one-byte `fs.readFile` paid, and
//! one thread per in-flight request. This pool keeps a few workers alive,
//! grows on demand when every worker is busy — a burst of parallel fetches
//! must not serialize behind a fixed count, since a transport blocks its
//! worker while the request is in flight — and lets the extra workers go
//! after a quiet spell. Process-wide: a job carries its own runtime state.
